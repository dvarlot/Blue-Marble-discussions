## Sequence of main events 

* initial Fundraising phase (about 2 to 4 months)
  * Donors make a donation for the development of the Dao and of the software tools and application
  * Donation are received by the DAO address of BM tech
  * Donors receive a BMO token (1 token for a $5 donation)
  * Founders transfer funds to the foundation up to a determined amount to fund the creation of the application 
  * Once that amount is achieved, the funds are redirected to the BMO treasury
* Continuous fundraising (starting after about 4 months )
  * Donors make donations to the treasury
  * Donors receive a BMO token (1 token for a $5 donation)
  * Donors can propose and vote on projects to fund
  * Donors have a veto on all votes to ensure we stay aligned on mission and value
* starting the community ( starting immediately)
  * Members receive 1 BMS token when they sign up
  * Donors automatically receive 1 BMS token
  * members receive more BMS tokens based on contribution
  * members vote on features of the app and initiatives
* several guilds are created 
  * Blue Marble origin: the donors - decide on projects to be executed
  * Blue marble tech: in charge of creating the app and tools - hired people and volunteers
  * Blue Marble experts and auditors: members with technical knowledge conducting activities of validation of information and confirmation of project impact


## Approach nÂº1
- Create 1 DAO per community
  - first DAO - Blue Marble tech
   - Multisig ( the 4  founders of the foundation)
   - other members will be added as wallet address later
  - Second DAO - Blue Marble origin
   - Token base (Blue Marble Origin - BMO)
   - At creation, premium to founders (some token)
  - 3rd DAO - Blue Marble
   - Token Base (Blue marble Gaia)
   - 1 token for each member when registering 
    - How to automatize this?
   - can receive more tokens based on contribution
   - Donors automatically receive one token 

- initial Fundraising mechanism
  - Each time a donation is sent to The BM Tech DAO, the donor receives BMO tokens (1 BMO token for $5 or 5 Matic  donation)
   - is it possible to have this in a smart contract as a proposition
- community: Blue Marble 
  - votes on reward and bounties
  - Bounties for project management
  - 3 sub categories
   - Experts 
   - project committe
   - auditors
   - can be managed by guilds based on wallet address or NFT 
- BMO
  - Vote on projects (funding and execution)
- BMtech
  - management of the development of the application and the software, and the DAOs 

## Questions
- how to implement guardians on the BMO and BM dao? - to ensure that the decision are in line with the mission and values
